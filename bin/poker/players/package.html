This package (or its subpackages) should contain all players that should be available for the game. <br>
<br>
It already contains a few simple players like a {@link poker.players.RandomPlayer random} or a
{@link poker.players.ui human} one. The human player provides a simple dialog to choose the desired
action. <br>
